# Rag-multipdf

### August 13, 2025 — Multiple-PDF Ingestion
- Implemented multi-file selection via `tkinter.filedialog`.
- Normalized metadata (filename + page).
- Applied `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (chunk_size=1000, overlap=150).
- Built FAISS index with OpenAI embeddings.
- Verified end-to-end pipeline (load → split → embed → retrieve → answer).
- Published `Simple_multiplepdf_uniqa.ipynb`.

---

### August 14, 2025 — Multiple-Q&A Mode
- Extended Q&A logic from single question to interactive loop.
- Allowed successive queries until blank input.
- Stateless behavior: each query independent.
- Published `Simple_multiplepdf_multiple_qa.ipynb`.

---

### August 15, 2025 — Context Memory
- Replaced stateless `RetrievalQA` with LCEL + `RunnableWithMessageHistory`.
- Preserved chat history across turns.
- Supported pronoun references and follow-up queries.
- Sources remain vectorstore metadata (not hallucinated).
- Published context-enabled notebook.

---

### August 19, 2025 — Multi-PDF Context Integration
- Added conversation memory to multiple-PDF pipeline.
- Q&A logic reorganized for coherent follow-ups.
- Answers + supporting sources displayed together.
- Validated with abbreviated queries (“ms?” after full question).
- Published `Simple_multiplepdf_context_qa.ipynb`.

---

### August 20, 2025 — Retrieved Snippet Support
- Returned raw text snippets alongside answers and sources.
- Improved transparency/debugging by showing retrieved context.
- Snippets shown even when answer is "I don't know".
- Published updated context-qa notebook.

---

### August 22, 2025 — Chunk Optimization (Grid & Refinement)
- Implemented grid search for `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`.
- Evaluated retrieval via average top-k similarity.
- Added local refinement: micro-adjustment of top-k windows.
- Demonstrated trade-off between brute-force vs. practical refinement.

---

### August 26–27, 2025 — Repository Consolidation
- Confirmed refinement-enabled notebook live in `Sample/`.
- Organized repo between baseline (multi-PDF + Q&A) and advanced (context + refinement).
- Verified environment requirements (LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI API).
- Drafted README notes with changelog.

---

### August 28, 2025 — Grid Search Integration
- Added optional flag `use_grid_search=True`.
- Automated parameter testing before FAISS index build.
- Fallback to defaults if disabled or failed.
- Validated automatic parameter selection in pipeline.
- Published updated notebook.

---

### September 2, 2025 — Refinement Enhancements
- Logged both original and refined similarity scores for top-k chunks.
- Displayed Δ improvement and candidate counts.
- Provided more interpretable retrieval feedback.

---

### September 3, 2025 — Repository Update
- Uploaded the grid search integration notebook to GitHub.
- Confirmed repository reflects latest stable features.
- Prepared repo for portfolio demonstration.
